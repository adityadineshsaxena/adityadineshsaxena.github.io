Hello reader!
I'm Aditya. I'm a coder. I work with McKinsey Digital Labs in Gurgaon/India as a Front-End engineer. I work with some great people here and with some of the best Front-End frameworks out there. As a Front-End group, we work with Data Visualizations using Highcharts and D3, Cordova/Ionic based iOS and Android applications and practically anything that floats around us in this domain.

My past-time activities include playing Cricket/Foosball, enjoying with my son, and keeping myself busy with trying to take in the information-overload!
